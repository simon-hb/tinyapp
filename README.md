# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten URLs into a condensed link of 6 random characters. This is my first application I have ever created. More to come!

### Project Description
My first web application does a lot of cool things! You can register, logout, and login. The cookies and database used to store log-in data are all encrypted or hashed so it is perfectly safe! Once logged in, you can create shortened URL's and use them the same as the long version. You can also see everything you created in a table and edit/ delete. Please navigate around and see for yourself!
